# Advanced Features

Explore Union AI's advanced capabilities to build sophisticated workflow solutions.

## Parallel Execution

Optimize workflow performance by running tasks in parallel.

```python
from unionai import Workflow, task, parallel

@parallel
def process_batch(items):
    return [item * 2 for item in items]

@Workflow
def parallel_workflow():
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    results = process_batch(data)
```

## Error Handling

Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.

```python
from unionai import Workflow, task, retry

@task(retries=3)
def fetch_data():
    # Implement retry logic
    pass

@task
def handle_error(error):
    # Custom error handling
    pass
```

## Dynamic Workflows

Create workflows that adapt to runtime conditions.

```python
from unionai import Workflow, task, condition

@Workflow
def dynamic_workflow(data_size):
    if condition(data_size > 1000):
        process_large_dataset()
    else:
        process_small_dataset()
```

## Custom Operators

Extend Union AI with custom operators for specialized tasks.

```python
from unionai import Operator, InputPort, OutputPort

class DataTransformOperator(Operator):
    input_data = InputPort()
    output_data = OutputPort()
    
    def process(self):
        # Custom transformation logic
        pass
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

Implement comprehensive workflow monitoring.

### Custom Metrics

```python
from unionai import metrics

@task
def tracked_task():
    metrics.counter("task_executions").inc()
    metrics.gauge("processing_time").set(1.5)
```
