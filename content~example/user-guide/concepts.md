# Basic Concepts

Understanding the core concepts of Union AI will help you make the most of the platform.

## Workflows

Workflows are the fundamental building blocks in Union AI. They define the sequence of tasks and their dependencies.

### Key Components

- **Tasks**: Individual units of work
- **Dependencies**: Relationships between tasks
- **Triggers**: Events that start workflow execution

## Environments

Environments represent isolated execution contexts for your workflows.

### Types of Environments

- **Development**: For testing and debugging
- **Staging**: For pre-production validation
- **Production**: For live workloads

## Resources

Resources are the computing assets available to your workflows.

### Resource Types

- **Compute Units**: Processing power allocation
- **Memory**: RAM allocation
- **Storage**: Persistent data storage

## Access Control

Union AI provides fine-grained access control mechanisms.

### Key Concepts

- **Roles**: Predefined sets of permissions
- **Policies**: Custom permission rules
- **Teams**: Groups of users with shared access
