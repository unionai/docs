# Best Practices

Follow these best practices to build reliable and maintainable workflows with Union AI.

## Workflow Design

### Modularity

- Break down complex workflows into smaller, reusable tasks
- Use meaningful names for tasks and workflows
- Keep task logic focused and single-purpose

### Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling for each task
- Use retries for transient failures
- Log errors with sufficient context

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Management

- Allocate appropriate resources for tasks
- Use caching for expensive computations
- Clean up temporary resources

### Parallel Processing

- Identify parallelizable tasks
- Use batch processing when appropriate
- Monitor parallel execution overhead

## Testing

### Unit Testing

- Test individual tasks in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Verify task inputs and outputs

### Integration Testing

- Test complete workflow execution
- Verify task dependencies
- Test error handling paths

## Monitoring

### Metrics

- Track key performance indicators
- Monitor resource utilization
- Set up alerts for critical metrics

### Logging

- Use structured logging
- Include relevant context in logs
- Implement log rotation

## Security

### Access Control

- Follow principle of least privilege
- Regularly review access permissions
- Secure sensitive data

### Secrets Management

- Use environment variables for secrets
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
