# Getting Started with Authentication

This guide will help you understand how to authenticate your requests to our API. We provide multiple authentication methods to ensure secure access to our services.

## Overview

All API requests must be authenticated using one of our supported authentication methods:
- API Keys (recommended for server-side applications)
- OAuth 2.0 (recommended for user-facing applications)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
1. Created an account on our platform
2. Access to the developer dashboard
3. Necessary permissions to create authentication credentials

## Quick Start

### Using API Keys

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.example.com/v1/resources
```

### Using OAuth 2.0

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  https://api.example.com/v1/resources
```
