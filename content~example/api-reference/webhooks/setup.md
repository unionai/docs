# Webhook Setup

This guide explains how to configure and manage webhooks to receive real-time updates from our API.

## Overview

Webhooks allow your application to receive automatic notifications when specific events occur in our system.

## Prerequisites

1. A publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint
2. Valid API credentials
3. Appropriate webhook permissions

## Setting Up Webhooks

### 1. Create a Webhook Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-domain.com/webhook",
    "events": ["user.created", "user.updated"],
    "description": "User events webhook"
  }'
```

### 2. Configure Your Endpoint

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook_handler():
    payload = request.json
    # Verify webhook signature
    # Process the webhook payload
    return '', 200
```

## Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "id": "evt_123abc",
  "type": "user.created",
  "created_at": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "usr_456def",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
}
```

## Security

### Signature Verification

```python
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_signature(payload, signature, secret):
    expected = hmac.new(
        secret.encode('utf-8'),
        payload.encode('utf-8'),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected, signature)
```

## Managing Webhooks

### List Webhooks

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/v1/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Update Webhook

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.example.com/v1/webhooks/{webhook_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "events": ["user.created", "user.updated", "user.deleted"]
  }'
```

### Delete Webhook

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.example.com/v1/webhooks/{webhook_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Best Practices

1. Implement proper error handling
2. Use HTTPS endpoints only
3. Verify webhook signatures
4. Implement retry logic
5. Process webhooks asynchronously

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Webhook endpoint not accessible
2. Invalid signature verification
3. Timeout during processing
4. Missing required headers

## Rate Limits

Webhook operations are subject to rate limits. See our [Rate Limits](/api-reference/rate-limits/overview/) documentation.
