# RBAC

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. In RBAC, users are assigned roles that define their level of access to resources. Roles are typically defined by the type of work they do, such as administrator, manager, or analyst.
