# Unit testing

The decorator and function documented below will help you unit test your Flyte tasks. They are particularly helpful for testing workflows that contain tasks that cannot run locally.

```{eval-rst}

.. currentmodule:: flytekit.testing

.. autodecorator:: patch

.. autofunction:: task_mock

```
