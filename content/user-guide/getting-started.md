# Getting started

This section gives you a quick introduction to writing and running workflows on Union.ai.


## Hello world

We'll start with a "Hello world" example.

Create a file called `hello.py` with the following content:

```python
# hello.py

import asyncio
from typing import List

import flyte

env = flyte.TaskEnvironment(name="hello_world")


@env.task
async def say_hello(data: str, lt: List[int]) -> str:
    print(f"say_hello - {flyte.ctx().action}")
    return f"Hello {data} {lt}"


@env.task
async def square(i: int = 3) -> int:
    print(f"square - {flyte.ctx().action}")
    return i * i


@env.task
async def hello_wf(data: str = "default string") -> str:
    print(f"hello_wf - {flyte.ctx().action}")
    coros = []
    for i in range(3):
        coros.append(square(i=i))

    vals = await asyncio.gather(*coros)
    return await say_hello(data=data, lt=vals)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    flyte.init_auto_from_config("./config.yaml")
    run = flyte.run(hello_wf, data="hello world")
    print(run.name)
    print(run.url)
    run.wait(run)
```

This script defines three asynchronous functions: `say_hello`, `square`, and `hello_wf`.
The `say_hello_wf` is the top-level "workflow" function that orchestrates the execution of the other two functions.

Now let's say that some parts of the above program could benefit from running in a different environment,
for example on a GPU or with more memory.
Obviously, this is not really the case in this example, but let's pretend.

With Flyte, you can easily augment your code with a few decorators and auxiliary functions, and it is ready to be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster where each function runs in its own container with, potentially, its own dependencies and specific hardware.

In our example above, we can achieve this as follows:
* Import the flyte package,
* Create a `TaskEnvironment`.
* Decorate your functions with `@env.task`.
* Change your main guard initialize and run the workflow using the Flyte SDK.

## Run the code on your Union.ai instance

First, make sure you are in a Python virtual environment, and you have the `flyte` package installed.
For example, you can use the [`uv` package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to create a virtual environment and install the `flyte` package like this:

```shell
$ uv venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ uv pip install --no-cache --prerelease=allow --upgrade flyte
```

Next make sure you have a `config.yaml` file in the same directory as your `hello.py` file that points to your Union.ai instance

Now, simply run the script:

```shell
$ python hello.py
```

You should see something like this:

```shell
