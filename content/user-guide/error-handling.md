# Error handling

One of the key features of Flyte 2 is the ability to recover from user-level errors in a workflow execution.
This includes out-of-memory errors and other exceptions.

This is a direct result of the fact that workflows are now written in regular Python, and provide you with all the power and flexibility of Python error handling.

[TODO: Add content and example

specifically about user level errors,
not system level errors (that will cone later)

Use ommer.py as an example
