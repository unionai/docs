# Mocking tasks

A lot of the tasks that you write you can run locally, but some of them you will not be able to, usually because they are tasks that depend on a third-party only available on the backend. Hive tasks are a common example, as most users will not have access to the service that executes Hive queries from their development environment. However, it's still useful to be able to locally run a workflow that calls such a task. In these instances, flytekit provides a couple of utilities to help navigate this.

For example, this is a generic SQL task (and is by default not hooked up to any datastore nor handled by any plugin), and must be mocked if it is to be used in a unit test like so:

```python
import datetime

import pandas
from flytekit import SQLTask, TaskMetadata, kwtypes, task, workflow
from flytekit.testing import patch, task_mock
from flytekit.types.schema import FlyteSchema

sql = SQLTask(
    "my-query",
    query_template="SELECT * FROM hive.city.fact_airport_sessions WHERE ds = '{{ .Inputs.ds }}' LIMIT 10",
    inputs=kwtypes(ds=datetime.datetime),
    outputs=kwtypes(results=FlyteSchema),
    metadata=TaskMetadata(retries=2),
)

@task
def t1() -> datetime.datetime:
    return datetime.datetime.now()
```


Suppose you have a workflow that uses these two tasks:

```python
@workflow
def my_wf() -> FlyteSchema:
    dt = t1()
    return sql(ds=dt)
```

Without a mock, calling the workflow would typically raise an exception, but with the `task_mock` construct, which returns a `MagicMock` object, we can override the return value.

```python
def test_demonstrate_mock():
    with task_mock(sql) as mock:
        mock.return_value = pandas.DataFrame(data={"x": [1, 2], "y": ["3", "4"]})
        assert (my_wf().open().all() == pandas.DataFrame(data={"x": [1, 2], "y": ["3", "4"]})).all().all()
```

There is another utility as well called `patch` which offers the same functionality, but in the traditional Python patching style, where the first argument is the `MagicMock` object.

```python
@patch(sql)
def test_demonstrate_patch(mock_sql):
    mock_sql.return_value = pandas.DataFrame(data={"x": [1, 2], "y": ["3", "4"]})
    assert (my_wf().open().all() == pandas.DataFrame(data={"x": [1, 2], "y": ["3", "4"]})).all().all()
```
