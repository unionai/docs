# CI/CD deployment

So far we have covered the steps of deploying a project manually from the command line.
In many cases, you will want to automate this process through a CI/CD system.
In this section, we explain how to set up a CI/CD system to register, execute and promote workflows on Union.
We will use GitHub Actions as the example CI/CD system.

## Create a Union app

An app is an agent registered in your Union data plane that enables external systems to perform actions in the system.
To enable your CI/CD system to authenticate with Union, you need to create a Union app.
See [Applications](../administration/applications.md).

First, create a specification file called `app.yaml` (for example) with the following contents (you can adjust the `clientId` and `clientName` to your requirements):

```{code-block} yaml
clientId: example-operator
clientName: Example Operator
grantTypes:
- CLIENT_CREDENTIALS
- AUTHORIZATION_CODE
redirectUris:
- http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback
responseTypes:
- CODE
tokenEndpointAuthMethod: CLIENT_SECRET_BASIC
```

Now, create the app using the specification file:

```{code-block} shell
[~/wine-classification]:wine-classification
$ uctl create app --appSpecFile app.yaml
```

The response should look something like this:

```{code-block} shell
 ------------------ ------------------- ------------- ---------
| NAME             | CLIENT NAME       | SECRET      | CREATED |
 ------------------ ------------------- ------------- ---------
| example-operator |  Example Operator | <AppSecret> |         |
 ------------------ ------------------- ------------- ---------
```

Copy the `<AppSecret>` to an editor for later use.
This is the only time that the secret will be displayed.
The secret is not stored by Union.

## Store the secret in your CI/CD secrets store

Store the secret in your CI/CD secrets store.
In GitHub, from the repository page:

1. Select **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
2. Select the **Secrets** tab and click **New repository secret**.
3. Give a meaningful name to the secret, like `UNION_APP_SECRET`.
4. Paste in the string from above as the value.
5. Click **Add secret**.

## Create a Union configuration file

Until now the configuration file we have used has been local (`~/.union/config.yaml`, for example).
For the CI/CD system you need to create one right in the same repository that holds your workflow code.

Create `example-project/ci-config.yaml`:

```{code-block} yaml
admin:
  endpoint: dns:///<union-host-url>
  clientId: example-operator
  clientSecretEnvVar: UNION_APP_SECRET
  insecure: false
logger:
  show-source: true
  level: 1
```

:::{note}
Note that the value of`clientSecretEnvVar`(in his case, `UNION_APP_SECRET`) is the name of the variable that will be used by `uctl` within the CI/CD run environment.

It is also usually good practice to make this the same as the name under which the secret is stored within the CI/CD secret store, as shown above.

## Set up your CI/CD configuration file

Finally, you need to set up the CI/CD configuration file. For GitHub Actions you might create the file `example-project/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml` that looks like this:

```{code-block} yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

env:
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  PROJECT: onboarding

jobs:
  build_and_register:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Build & Push Docker Image to Github Registry
        uses: whoan/docker-build-with-cache-action@v5
        with:
          # https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/publishing-a-package
          username: ${{ secrets.UNIONAI_OSS_BOT_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.UNIONAI_OSS_BOT_PASSWORD }}
          image_name: ${{ github.repository }}
          image_tag: ${{ env.PROJECT }}-${{ github.sha }},${{ env.PROJECT }}-latest
          registry: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}
          context: ./${{ env.PROJECT }}
          dockerfile: Dockerfile

      - name: Setup union
        run: |
          sudo apt-get install python3
          pip install -r ${{ env.PROJECT }}/requirements.txt
      - name: Setup uctl
        run: |
          curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unionai/uctl/main/install.sh | bash
      - name: Package
        working-directory: ./${{ env.PROJECT }}
        run: |
          union --pkgs workflows package \
            --output ./flyte-package.tgz \
            --image ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ github.repository_owner }}/${{ github.repository }}:${{ env.PROJECT }}-latest
      - name: Register
        env:
          UNION_APP_SECRET: ${{ secrets.UNION_APP_SECRET }}
        run: |
          bin/uctl --config ./ci-config.yaml \
            register files \
            --project onboarding \
            --domain production \
            --archive ./${{ env.PROJECT }}/flyte-package.tgz \
            --version ${{ github.sha }}
```

:::{note}
Note this section:

```{code-block} yaml
- name: Register
  env:
    UNION_APP_SECRET: ${{ secrets.UNION_APP_SECRET }}
```

The first instance of the name`UNION_APP_SECRET`must be the same as that specified in the `ci-config.yaml` file as the value of `clientSecretEnvVar`.

Because we have followed the practice of using the same name for the secret stored in the CI/CD secret store, the value being retrieved here has the same name, `secrets.UNION_APP_SECRET.`

You will also see other secrets and environment variables accessed in this configuration file.
These are related to the container build process, project name and so forth.
For details, have a look at the GitHub docs and the docs for the tool used above, `whoan/docker-build-with-cache-action`.
:::

Once this is set up, every push to the main branch in you repository will build and deploy your project to Union.
