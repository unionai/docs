# Running your code

## Set up your development environment

If you have not already done so, follow the [Getting started](../getting-started) section to sign in to {{< key product_name >}}, and set up your local environment.

## CLI commands for running your code

The {{< key cli_name >}} CLI and {{<key ctl_name >}} CLI provide commands that allow you to deploy and run your code at different stages of the development cycle:

<!-- TODO: Link to the union commands below to the reference section -->

1. `{{< key cli >}} run`: For deploying and running a single script immediately in your local Python environment.
2. `{{< key cli >}} run --remote`: For deploying and running a single script immediately in the cloud on {{< key product_name >}}.
3. `{{< key cli >}} register`: For deploying multiple scripts to {{< key product_name >}} and running them from the Web interface.

4. `{{< key cli >}} package` and `{{<key ctl >}} register`: For deploying workflows to production and for scripting within a CI/CD pipeline.

> [!NOTE]
> In some cases, you may want to test your code in a local cluster before deploying it to {{< key product_name >}}.
> This step corresponds to using the commands 2, 3, or 4, but targeting your local cluster instead of {{< key product_name >}}.
> For more details, see [Running in a local cluster](./running-in-a-local-cluster).

## Running a script in local Python with `{{< key cli >}} run` {#running-a-script-in-local-python}

During the development cycle you will want to run a specific workflow or task in your local Python environment to test it.
To quickly try out the code locally use `{{< key cli >}} run`:

```shell
$ {{< key cli >}} run workflows/example.py wf --name 'Albert'
```

Here you are invoking `{{< key cli >}} run` and passing the name of the Python file and the name of the workflow within that file that you want to run.
In addition, you are passing the named parameter `name` and its value.

## Running a script on {{< key product_name >}} with `{{< key cli >}} run --remote`

To quickly run a workflow on {{< key product_name >}}, use `{{< key cli >}} run --remote`:

```shell
$ {{< key cli >}} run --remote --project basic-example --domain development workflows/example.py wf --name 'Albert'
```

Here we are invoking `{{< key cli >}} run --remote` and passing:
* The project, `basic-example`
* The domain, `development`
* The Python file, `workflows/example.py`
* The workflow within that file that you want to run, `wf`
* The named parameter `name`, and its value

This command will:
* Build the container image defined in your `ImageSpec`.

{{< variant flyte >}}
{{< markdown >}}

* Push the image to the container registry specified in that `ImageSpec`. Don't forget make the image accessible to {{< key product_name >}}. For example, if you are using GitHub Container Registry, you will need to make the image public.

{{< /variant >}}

* Package up your code and deploy it to the specified project and domain in {{< key product_name >}}.
* Run the workflow on {{< key product_name >}}.

This command is useful for quickly deploying and running a specific workflow on {{< key product_name >}}.

## Running tasks through {{< key ctl >}}

This is a multi-step process where we create an execution spec file, update the spec file, and then create the execution.

### Generate execution spec file

```shell
$ {{< key ctl >}} launch task --project flytesnacks --domain development --name workflows.example.generate_normal_df --version v1
```

### Update the input spec file for arguments to the workflow

```yaml
iamRoleARN: 'arn:aws:iam::12345678:role/defaultrole'
inputs:
  n: 200
  mean: 0.0
  sigma: 1.0
kubeServiceAcct: ""
targetDomain: ""
targetProject: ""
task: workflows.example.generate_normal_df
version: "v1"
```

### Create execution using the exec spec file

```shell
$ {{< key ctl >}} create execution -p flytesnacks -d development --execFile exec_spec.yaml
```

### Monitor the execution by providing the execution id from create command

```shell
$ {{< key ctl >}} get execution -p flytesnacks -d development <execid>
```

## Running workflows through {{< key ctl >}}

Workflows on their own are not runnable directly. However, a launchplan is always bound to a workflow (at least the auto-create default launch plan) and you can use
launchplans to `launch` a workflow. The `default launchplan` for a workflow has the same name as its workflow and all argument defaults are also identical.

Tasks also can be executed using the launch command.
One difference between running a task and a workflow via launchplans is that launchplans cannot be associated with a
task. This is to avoid triggers and scheduling.

## Running launchplans through {{< key ctl >}}

{{< variant flyte >}}

This is multi-step process where we create an execution spec file, update the spec file and then create the execution.

### Generate an execution spec file

```shell
$ {{< key ctl >}} get launchplan -p flytesnacks -d development myapp.workflows.example.my_wf  --execFile exec_spec.yaml
```

### Update the input spec file for arguments to the workflow

```yaml
inputs:
    name: "adam"
```

### Create execution using the exec spec file

```shell
$ {{< key ctl >}} create execution -p flytesnacks -d development --execFile exec_spec.yaml
```

### Monitor the execution by providing the execution id from create command

```bash
$ {{< key ctl >}} get execution -p flytesnacks -d development <execid>
```

## Deploying your code to {{< key product_name >}} with `{{< key cli >}} register`

```shell
$ {{< key cli >}} register workflows --project basic-example --domain development
```

Here we are registering all the code in the `workflows` directory to the project `basic-example` in the domain `development`.

This command will:
* Build the container image defined in your `ImageSpec`.
* Package up your code and deploy it to the specified project and domain in {{< key product_name >}}.
  The package will contain the code in the Python package located in the `workflows` directory.
  Note that the presence of the `__init__.py` file in this directory is necessary in order to make it a Python package.

The command will not run the workflow. You can run it from the Web interface.

This command is useful for deploying your full set of workflows to {{< key product_name >}} for testing.

### Fast registration

`{{< key cli >}} register` packages up your code through a mechanism called fast registration.
Fast registration is useful when you already have a container image that’s hosted in your container registry of choice, and you change your workflow/task code without any changes in your system-level/Python dependencies. At a high level, fast registration:

* Packages and zips up the directory/file that you specify as the argument to `{{< key cli >}} register`, along with any files in the root directory of your project. The result of this is a tarball that is packaged into a `.tar.gz` file, which also includes the serialized task (in `protobuf` format) and workflow specifications defined in your workflow code.

* Registers the package to the specified cluster and uploads the tarball containing the user-defined code into the configured blob store (e.g. S3, GCS).

At workflow execution time, {{< key product_name >}} knows to automatically inject the zipped up task/workflow code into the running container, thereby overriding the user-defined tasks/workflows that were originally baked into the image.

<!-- TODO: determine if this section should be included. There was some discussion of flyteignore no longer being relevant

Ignoring files during fast registration

In step (1) of the fast registration process, by default Flyte will package up all user-defined code at the root of your project. In some cases, your project directory may contain datasets, model files, and other potentially large artifacts that you want to exclude from the tarball.

You can do so by specifying these files in a .flyteignore file in the root of your project. You can also use .gitignore or .dockerignore if you’d like to avoid adding another file.
-->

> [!NOTE] `WORKDIR`, `PYTHONPATH`, and `PATH`
> When executing any of the above commands, the archive that gets creates is extracted wherever the `WORKDIR` is set.
> This can be handled directly via the `WORKDIR` directive in a `Dockerfile`, or specified via `source_root` if using `ImageSpec`.
> This is important for discovering code and executables via `PATH` or `PYTHONPATH`.
> A common pattern for making your Python packages fully discoverable is to have a top-level `src` folder, adding that to your `PYTHONPATH`,
> and making all your imports absolute.
> This avoids having to “install” your Python project in the image at any point e.g. via `pip install -e`.

## Inspecting executions

{{< variant flyte >}}
{{< markdown >}}

{{< key ctl_name >}} supports inspecting execution by retrieving its details. For a deeper dive, refer to the
[API reference](../../api-reference/flytectl-cli/_index) guide.

{{< key ctl_name >}} supports inspecting execution by retrieving its details. For a deeper dive, refer to the
[API reference](../../api-reference/uctl-cli/_index) guide.

{{< /markdown >}}
{{< /variant >}}

Monitor the execution by providing the execution id from create command which can be task or workflow execution.

```shell
$ {{< key ctl >}} get execution -p flytesnacks -d development <execid>
```

For more details use `--details` flag which shows node executions along with task executions on them.

```shell
$ {{< key ctl >}} get execution -p flytesnacks -d development <execid> --details
```

If you prefer to see yaml/json view for the details then change the output format using the -o flag.

```shell
$ {{< key ctl >}} get execution -p flytesnacks -d development <execid> --details -o yaml
```

To see the results of the execution you can inspect the node closure outputUri in detailed yaml output.

```shell
"outputUri": "s3://my-s3-bucket/metadata/propeller/flytesnacks-development-<execid>/n0/data/0/outputs.pb"
```

## Deploying your code to production

### Package your code with `{{< key cli >}} package`

The combination of `{{< key cli >}} package` and `{{< key ctl >}} register` is the standard way of deploying your code to production.
This method is often used in scripts to [build and deploy workflows in a CI/CD pipeline](./ci-cd-deployment).

First, package your workflows:

```shell
$ {{< key cli >}} --pkgs workflows package
```

This will create a tar file called `flyte-package.tgz` of the Python package located in the `workflows` directory.
Note that the presence of the `__init__.py` file in this directory is necessary in order to make it a Python package.

> [!NOTE]
> You can specify multiple workflow directories using the following command:
>
> `{{< key cli >}} --pkgs DIR1 --pkgs DIR2 package ...`
>
> This is useful in cases where you want to register two different projects that you maintain in a single place.
>
> If you encounter a ModuleNotFoundError when packaging, use the --source option to include the correct source paths. For instance:
>
> `{{< key cli >}} --pkgs <dir1> package --source ./src -f`

### Register the package with `{{< key ctl >}} register`

Once the code is packaged you register it using the `{{< key ctl >}}` CLI:

```shell
$ {{< key ctl >}} register files \
      --project basic-example
      --domain development \
      --archive flyte-package.tgz
      --version "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

Let’s break down what each flag is doing here:

* `--project`: The target {{< key product_name >}} project.

* `--domain`:  The target domain. Usually one of `development`, `staging`, or `production`.

* `--archive`: This argument allows you to pass in a package file, which in this case is the `flyte-package.tgz` produced earlier.

* `--version`: This is a version string that can be any string, but we recommend using the Git SHA in general, especially in production use cases.

## Using {{< key cli >}} register versus {{< key cli >}} package + {{< key ctl >}} register

As a rule of thumb, `{{< key cli >}} register` works well when you are working on a single cluster and iterating quickly on your task/workflow code.

On the other hand, `{{< key cli >}} package` and `{{< key ctl >}} register` is appropriate if you are:

* Working with multiple clusters, since it uses a portable package

* Deploying workflows to a production context

* Testing your workflows in your CI/CD infrastructure.

> [!NOTE] Programmatic Python API
> You can also perform the equivalent of the three methods of registration using a [{{< key kit_remote >}} object](../development-cycle/union-remote/_index).

## Image management and registration method

The `ImageSpec` construct available in `{{< key kit >}}` also has a mechanism to copy files into the image being built.
Its behavior depends on the type of registration used:

* If fast register is used, then it’s assumed that you don’t also want to copy source files into the built image.

* If fast register is not used (which is the default for `{{< key cli >}} package`, or if `{{< key cli >}} register --copy none` is specified), then it’s assumed that you do want source files copied into the built image.

* If your `ImageSpec` constructor specifies a `source_root` and the `copy` argument is set to something other than `CopyFileDetection.NO_COPY`, then files will be copied regardless of fast registration status.

## Building your own images

{{< variant byoc byok serverless >}}
{{< markdown >}}

While we recommend that you use `ImageSpec` and the `union` cloud image builder, you can, if you wish build and deploy your own images.

{{< /markdown >}}
{{< /variant >}}
{{< variant flyte >}}
{{< markdown >}}

While we recommend that you use `ImageSpec` and the `envd` image builder on registration, you can, if you wish build and deploy your own images separately.

{{< /markdown >}}
{{< /variant >}}

You can start with `{{< key cli >}} init --template basic-template-dockerfile`, the resulting template project includes a `docker_build.sh` script that you can use to build and tag a container according to the recommended practice:

```shell
$ ./docker_build.sh
```

By default, the `docker_build.sh` script:

* Uses the `PROJECT_NAME` specified in the {{< key cli >}}  command, which in this case is my_project.

* Will not use any remote registry.

* Uses the Git SHA to version your tasks and workflows.

You can override the default values with the following flags:

```shell
$ ./docker_build.sh -p PROJECT_NAME -r REGISTRY -v VERSION
```

For example, if you want to push your Docker image to Github’s container registry you can specify the `-r ghcr.io` flag.

> [!NOTE]
> The `docker_build.sh` script is purely for convenience; you can always roll your own way of building Docker containers.

Once you’ve built the image, you can push it to the specified registry. For example, if you’re using Github container registry, do the following:

```shell
$ docker login ghcr.io
$ docker push TAG
```

## CI/CD with Flyte and GitHub Actions

You can use any of the commands we learned in this guide to register, execute, or test {{< key product_name >}} workflows in your CI/CD process.
{{< key product_name >}} provides two GitHub actions that facilitate this:

* `flyte-setup-action`: This action handles the installation of {{< key ctl >}} in your action runner.

* `flyte-register-action`: This action uses `{{< key ctl >}} register` under the hood to handle registration of packages, for example, the `.tgz` archives that are created by `{{< key cli >}} package`.

### Some CI/CD best practices

In the case where workflows are registered on each commit in your build pipelines, you can consider the following recommendations and approach:

* **Versioning Strategy** : Determining the version of the build for different types of commits makes them consistent and identifiable.
  For commits on feature branches, use `{branch-name}-{short-commit-hash}` and for the ones on main branches, use `main-{short-commit-hash}`.
  Use version numbers for the released (tagged) versions.

* **Workflow Serialization and Registration** : Workflows should be serialized and registered based on the versioning of the build and the container image.
  Depending on whether the build is for a feature branch or `main`, the registration domain should be adjusted accordingly.

* **Container Image Specification** : When managing multiple images across tasks within a workflow, use the `--image` flag during registration to specify which image to use.
  This avoids hardcoding the image within the task definition, promoting reusability and flexibility in workflows.
