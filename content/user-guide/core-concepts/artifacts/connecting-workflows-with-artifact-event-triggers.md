# Connecting workflows with artifact event triggers

In the following example, we define an upstream workflow and a downstream workflow, and define a [trigger](../launch-plans/reactive-workflows/) in a launch plan to connect the two workflows via an [artifact event](../launch-plans/reactive-workflows#artifact-events).

## Imports

{{< variant byoc byok flyte >}}
{{< markdown >}}
> [!NOTE]
> To use the example code on this page, you will need to add your `registry` to the `pandas_image` ImageSpec block.
{{< /markdown >}}
{{< /variant >}}

First we import the required packages:

```python
from datetime import datetime

import pandas as pd
import {{< key kit_import >}}
from {{< key kit >}}.artifacts import OnArtifact
from flytekit.core.artifact import Inputs
from typing_extensions import Annotated

```

## Upstream artifact and workflow definition

Then we define an upstream artifact and a workflow that emits a new version of `UpstreamArtifact` when executed:

```python
UpstreamArtifact = {{< key kit_as >}}.Artifact(
    name="my_upstream_artifact",
    time_partitioned=True,
    partition_keys=["key1"],
)


@{{< key kit_as >}}.task(container_image=pandas_image)
def upstream_t1(key1: str) -> Annotated[pd.DataFrame, UpstreamArtifact(key1=Inputs.key1)]:
    dt = datetime.now()
    my_df = pd.DataFrame({"col1": [1, 2, 3], "col2": ["a", "b", "c"]})
    return UpstreamArtifact.create_from(my_df, key1=key1, time_partition=dt)


@{{< key kit_as >}}.workflow
def upstream_wf() -> pd.DataFrame:
    return upstream_t1(key1="value1")
```

## Artifact event definition

Next we define the artifact event that will link the upstream and downstream workflows together:

```python
on_upstream_artifact = OnArtifact(
    trigger_on=UpstreamArtifact,
)
```

## Downstream workflow definition

Then we define the downstream task and workflow that will be triggered when the upstream artifact is created:

```python
@{{< key kit_as >}}.task
def downstream_t1():
    print("Downstream task triggered")


@{{< key kit_as >}}.workflow
def downstream_wf():
    downstream_t1()
```

## Launch plan with trigger definition

Finally, we create a launch plan with a trigger set to an `OnArtifact` object to link the two workflows via the `Upstream` artifact. The trigger will initiate an execution of the downstream `downstream_wf` workflow upon the creation of a new version of the `Upstream` artifact.

```python
downstream_triggered = {{< key kit_as >}}.LaunchPlan.create(
    "downstream_with_trigger_lp",
    downstream_wf,
    trigger=on_upstream_artifact
)
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `OnArtifact` object must be attached to a launch plan in order for the launch plan to be triggered by the creation of a new version of the artifact.

## Full example code

Here is the full example code file:

```python
# trigger_on_artifact.py
from datetime import datetime

import pandas as pd
import {{< key kit_import >}}
from {{< key kit >}}.artifacts import OnArtifact
from flytekit.core.artifact import Inputs
from typing_extensions import Annotated


pandas_image = {{< key kit_as >}}.ImageSpec(
    packages=["pandas==2.2.2"]
)

UpstreamArtifact = {{< key kit_as >}}.Artifact(
    name="my_upstream_artifact",
    time_partitioned=True,
    partition_keys=["key1"],
)


@{{< key kit_as >}}.task(container_image=pandas_image)
def upstream_t1(key1: str) -> Annotated[pd.DataFrame, UpstreamArtifact(key1=Inputs.key1)]:
    dt = datetime.now()
    my_df = pd.DataFrame({"col1": [1, 2, 3], "col2": ["a", "b", "c"]})
    return UpstreamArtifact.create_from(my_df, key1=key1, time_partition=dt)


@{{< key kit_as >}}.workflow
def upstream_wf() -> pd.DataFrame:
    return upstream_t1(key1="value1")


on_upstream_artifact = OnArtifact(
    trigger_on=UpstreamArtifact,
)


@{{< key kit_as >}}.task
def downstream_t1():
    print("Downstream task triggered")


@{{< key kit_as >}}.workflow
def downstream_wf():
    downstream_t1()


downstream_triggered = {{< key kit_as >}}.LaunchPlan.create(
    "downstream_with_trigger_lp",
    downstream_wf,
    trigger=on_upstream_artifact
)
```
