# Accelerators

{{< variant serverless >}}
{{< markdown >}}

{{< key product_name >}} allows you to specify [requests and limits](./customizing-task-resources) for the number of GPUs available for a given task.
However, in some cases, you may want to be more specific about the type of GPU to be used.

You can use the `accelerator` parameter to specify specific GPU types.

{{< key product_name >}} Serverless comes with three GPU types available:

* [NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU](#nvidia-t4-tensor-core-gpu)
* [NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPU](#nvidia-l4-tensor-core-gpu)
* [NVIDIA A100 GPU](#nvidia-a100-gpu)

Pricing for these GPUs can found on the [{{< key product_name >}} Pricing page](https://www.union.ai/pricing#:~:text=*Serverless%20compute%20pricing).

## NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU

The **NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU** is the default.
To use it for a task, specify the number of GPUs required in the `limits` parameter:

```python
@{{< key kit_as >}}.task(
    limits=Resources(gpu="1")
)
def my_task():
    ...
```

Or, you can explicitly specify the `accelerator` parameter as follows:

```python
@{{< key kit_as >}}.task(
    limits=Resources(gpu="1"),
    accelerator=GPUAccelerator("nvidia-tesla-t4")
)
def my_task():
    ...
```

## NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPU

To use the **NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPU** for a task, you must specify the number of GPUs required in the `limits` parameter, and also specify the `accelerator` parameter as follows:

```python
from flytekit.extras.accelerators import L4

@{{< key kit_as >}}.task(
    requests=Resources(gpu="1"),
    accelerator=L4,
)
def my_task():
    ...
```

## NVIDIA A100 GPU

To use the **NVIDIA A100 GPU** for a task you must specify the number of GPUs required in the `limits` parameter, and also specify the `accelerator` parameter as follows:

```python
@{{< key kit_as >}}.task(
    requests=Resources(gpu="1"),
    accelerator=GPUAccelerator("nvidia-tesla-a100"),
)
def my_task():
    ...
```

> [!NOTE] _Accelerators_ and _Accelerated datasets_ are entirely different things
> An accelerator, in {{< key product_name >}}, is a specialized hardware device that is used to accelerate the execution of a task.
> [Accelerated datasets](../../../data-input-output/accelerated-datasets), on the other hand, is a {{< key product_name >}} feature that enables quick access to large datasets from within a task.
> These concepts are entirely different and should not be confused.

{{< key product_name >}} allows you to specify [requests and limits](./customizing-task-resources) for the number of GPUs available for a given task.
However, in some cases, you may want to be more specific about the type of GPU or other specialized device to be used.

You can use the `accelerator` parameter to specify specific GPU types, variations of GPU types, fractional GPUs, or other specialized hardware devices such as TPUs.

Your {{< key product_name >}} installation will come pre-configured with the GPUs and other hardware that you requested during onboarding.
Each device type has a constant name that you can use to specify the device in the `accelerator` parameter.
For example:

```python
from flytekit.extras.accelerators import A100

    @{{< key kit_as >}}.task(
        limits=Resources(gpu="1"),
        accelerator=A100,
    )
    def my_task():
        ...

```

## Finding your available accelerators

You can find the accelerators available in your {{< key product_name >}} installation by going to the **Usage > Compute** dashboard in the UI.
In the **Accelerators** section, you will see a list of available accelerators and the named constants to be used in code to refer to them.

## Requesting the provisioning of accelerators

If you need a specific accelerator that is not available in your {{< key product_name >}} installation, you can request it by contacting the {{< key product_name >}} team.
Just click on the **Adjust Configuration** button under **Usage** in the UI (or go [here](https://get.support.union.ai/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/6/create/30)).

## Using predefined accelerator constants

There are a number of predefined accelerator constants available in the `flytekit.extras.accelerators` module.

The predefined list is not exhaustive, but it includes the most common accelerators.
If you know the name of the accelerator, but there is no predefined constant for it, you can simply pass the string name to the task decorator directly.

Note that in order for a specific accelerator to be available in your {{< key product_name >}} installation, it must have been provisioned by the {{< key product_name >}} team.

{{< variant flyte >}}
{{< markdown >}}

Flyte allows you to specify [requests and limits](./customizing-task-resources) for the number of GPUs available for a given task.
However, in some cases, you may want to be more specific about the type of GPU or other specialized device to be used.

You can use the `accelerator` parameter to specify specific GPU types, variations of GPU types, fractional GPUs, or other specialized hardware devices such as TPUs.

Each device type has a constant name that you can use to specify the device in the `accelerator` parameter.
For example:

```python
from flytekit.extras.accelerators import A100

    @{{< key kit_as >}}.task(
        limits=Resources(gpu="1"),
        accelerator=A100,
    )
    def my_task():
        ...

```

## Using predefined accelerator constants

There are a number of predefined accelerator constants available in the `flytekit.extras.accelerators` module.

The predefined list is not exhaustive, but it includes the most common accelerators.
If you know the name of the accelerator, but there is no predefined constant for it, you can simply pass the string name to the task decorator directly.

Note that in order for a specific accelerator to be available in your Flyte installation, it must have been provisioned in your Flyte cluster as part of your [deployment](../../../../deployment).

If using the constants, you can import them directly from the module, e.g.:

```python
from flytekit.extras.accelerators import T4

@{{< key kit_as >}}.task(
    limits=Resources(gpu="1"),
    accelerator=T4,
)
def my_task():
    ...

```

if you want to use a fractional GPU, you can use the `partitioned` method on the accelerator constant, e.g.:

```python
from flytekit.extras.accelerators import A100

@{{< key kit_as >}}.task(
    limits=Resources(gpu="1"),
    accelerator=A100.partition_2g_10gb,
)
def my_task():
    ...
```
