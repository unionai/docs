# Google BigQuery Plugin


This guide provides an overview of setting up BigQuery in your Flyte deployment.
Please note that the BigQuery plugin requires Flyte deployment in the GCP cloud;
it is not compatible with demo/AWS/Azure.

## Set up the GCP Flyte cluster


* Ensure you have a functional Flyte cluster running in `GCP <https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/deployment/gcp/index.html#deployment-gcp>`__.
* Create a service account for BigQuery. For more details, refer to [GCP docs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries).
* Verify that you have the correct kubeconfig and have selected the appropriate Kubernetes context.
* Confirm that you have the correct Flytectl configuration at ``~/.flyte/config.yaml``.

## Specify plugin configuration

### flyte-binary

Edit the relevant YAML file to specify the plugin.

```yaml

      tasks:
        task-plugins:
          enabled-plugins:
            - container
            - sidecar
            - bigquery
          default-for-task-types:
            - container: container
            - bigquery_query_job_task: bigquery
```

### flyte-core

Create a file named ``values-override.yaml`` and add the following configuration to it.

```yaml
        configmap:
          enabled_plugins:
            # -- Tasks specific configuration [structure](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/flyteorg/flytepropeller/pkg/controller/nodes/task/config#GetConfig)
            tasks:
              # -- Plugins configuration, [structure](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/flyteorg/flytepropeller/pkg/controller/nodes/task/config#TaskPluginConfig)
              task-plugins:
                # -- [Enabled Plugins](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/flyteorg/flyteplugins/go/tasks/config#Config). Enable sagemaker*, athena if you install the backend
                enabled-plugins:
                  - container
                  - sidecar
                  - k8s-array
                  - bigquery
                default-for-task-types:
                  container: container
                  sidecar: sidecar
                  container_array: k8s-array
                  bigquery_query_job_task: bigquery
```

Ensure that flytepropeller has the correct service account for BigQuery.

## Upgrade the Flyte Helm release


```bash
helm upgrade <RELEASE_NAME> flyteorg/<HELM_CHART> -n <YOUR_NAMESPACE> --values values-override.yaml

```

Replace ``<RELEASE_NAME>`` with the name of your release (e.g., ``flyte-backend``),
``<YOUR_NAMESPACE>`` with the name of your namespace (e.g., ``flyte``) and `<HELM_CHART>` with `flyte-binary`, `flyte-core ` or `flyte-sandbox`.


Wait for the upgrade to complete. You can check the status of the deployment pods by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n flyte
```

Once all the components are up and running, go to the examples section to learn more about how to use Flyte plugins.
