# Enabling AWS ECR

## Access to ECR in the same account is enabled by default

When registering tasks and workflows, the {{< key product_name >}} infrastructure in your data plane must have access to the container registry that holds the task container images you will be using.
If your data plane is on AWS then you may want to use AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to store these images.

For details on how to use ECR when building and deploying your workflows, see [ImageSpec with ECR](../../user-guide/core-concepts/tasks/task-software-environment/image-spec-with-ecr).

**In most cases, you will be using an ECR instance in the same AWS account as your data plane.**
**If this is the case, then you do not need to configure anything.**
**Access to ECR in the same account is enabled by default.**

## Enabling cross-account access to ECR

If you want to store your task container images in an ECR instance in an AWS account _other than the one that holds your data plane_, then you will have to configure that ECR instance to permit access from your data plane.
Here are the details:

* Your {{< key product_name >}} data plane comes pre-configured with a specific role, which we will refer to here as `<FlyteWorkerNodeGroupRole>`.
* The actual name of this role depends on your organization's name. It will be of the form `unionai-<YourOrganizationName>-flyteworker-node-group`.

To enable access to the ECR instance in the other account, do the following:

* In your data plane AWS account, Go to **IAM > Roles**.
Find the role `<FlyteWorkerNodeGroupRole>` and copy the ARN of that role.
We will call this `<FlyteWorkerNodeGroupRoleARN>`.
* In the other AWS account (the one that contains the ECR instance), go to **Amazon ECR > Repositories**,
* Find the ECR repository you want to enable and under **Permissions**, select **Edit,** then **Add Statement**.
* Specify the `<FlyteWorkerNodeGroupRoleARN>` as a **Principal** and add (at least) the following permissions:
  * `ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability`: This permission allows your data plane to check the availability of image layers in the registry.
  * `ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer`: This permission allows your data plane to retrieve a pre-signed URL that is required to download the image layers.
  * `ecr:BatchGetImage`: This permission allows your data plane to retrieve image manifests and image layer information from the registry.
* To specify the above parameters via JSON, select **Edit policy JSON** and use the following policy document:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowPull",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "<FlyteWorkerNodeGroupRoleARN>"
      },
      "Action": [
        "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
        "ecr:BatchGetImage",
        "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

* Select **Save**.

Your {{< key product_name >}} data plane infrastructure should now be able to pull images from the ECR instance.
