# Security Overview


Here we cover the security aspects of running your flyte deployments. In the current state, we will cover the user
used for running the flyte services, and go through why we do this and not run them as a root user.

# Using the Non-root User

It's considered to be a best practice to use a non-root user for security because
running in a constrained permission environment will prevent any malicious code
from utilizing the full permissions of the host [source](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/18/11-ways-not-to-get-hacked/#8-run-containers-as-a-non-root-user)
Moreover, in certain container platforms like [OpenShift](https://engineering.bitnami.com/articles/running-non-root-containers-on-openshift.html),
running non-root containers is mandatory.

Flyte uses OCI-compatible container technology like Docker for container packaging,
and by default, its containers run as root. This gives full permissions to the
system but may not be suitable for production deployments where a security breach
could comprise your application deployments.


## Changes

A new user group and user have been added to the Docker files for all the Flyte components:
[Flyteadmin](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteadmin/blob/master/Dockerfile),
[Flytepropeller](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytepropeller/blob/master/Dockerfile),
[Datacatalog](https://github.com/flyteorg/datacatalog/blob/master/Dockerfile),
[Flyteconsole](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteconsole/blob/master/Dockerfile).

Dockerfile uses the [USER command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user), which sets the user
and group, that's used for running the container.

Additionally, the K8s manifest files for the flyte components define the overridden security context with the created
user and group to run them. The following shows the overridden security context added for flyteadmin
[Flyteadmin](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/blob/master/charts/flyte/templates/admin/deployment.yaml).


## Overriding base configuration

Certain init-containers still require root permissions, and hence we are required to override the security
context for these.
For example: in the case of [Flyteadmin](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/blob/master/charts/flyte/templates/admin/deployment.yaml),
the init container of check-db-ready that runs postgres-provided docker image cannot resolve the host for the checks and fails. This is mostly due to no read
permissions on etc/hosts file. Only the check-db-ready container is run using the root user, which we will also plan to fix.


## Running flyteadmin and flyteconsole on different domains

In some cases when flyteadmin and flyteconsole are running on different domains,
you'll would need to allow the flyteadmin's domain to allow cross origin request
from the flyteconsole's domain. Here are all the domains/namespaces to keep in
mind:

- ``<flyte-admin-domain>``: the domain which will get the request.
- ``<flyte-console-domain>``: the domain which will be sending the request as the originator.
- ``<flyteconsole-ns>``: the k8s namespace where your flyteconsole pod is running.
- ``<flyteadmin-ns>``: the k8s namespace where your flyteadmin pod is running.

### Modify FlyteAdmin Config

To modify the FlyteConsole deployment to use ``<flyte-admin-domain>``, do the following:
1. Edit the deployment:
```bash
kubectl edit deployment flyteconsole -n <flyteconsole-ns>
```
```yaml

   - env:
     - name: ENABLE_GA
       value: "true"
     - name: GA_TRACKING_ID
       value: G-0123456789
     - name: ADMIN_API_URL
       value: https://<flyte-admin-domain>
```
2. Rollout the flyteconsole deployment:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/flyteconsole -n <flyteconsole-ns>
```
Modify the `flyte-admin-config` as follows:

```bash
kubectl edit configmap flyte-admin-config -n <flyteadmin-ns>
```
```yaml
   security:
     allowCors: true
     ......
     allowedOrigins:
     - 'https://<flyte-console-domain>'
     ......
```
3. Finally, rollout FlyteAdmin

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/flyteadmin -n <flyteadmin-ns>
```
