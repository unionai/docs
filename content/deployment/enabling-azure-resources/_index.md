# Enabling Azure resources

Components of your {{< key product_name >}} data plane will need to connect to and communicate with other resources in your Azure cloud environment, such as Azure [Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/storage/blobs/) and [Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-registry).

[Data plane setup on Azure](../data-plane-setup-on-azure) provides {{< key product_name >}} with the necessary permissions to manage underlying Azure resources within your data plane. Access to non-{{< key product_name >}} Azure resources is subject to Azure limitations and will require additional configuration.

As your projects evolve, your needs may change.
You can always contact the {{< key product_name >}} team for help enabling additional resources as required.

## Types of access

There are two categories of access that you are likely to have to deal with:

* **Infrastructure access**:
  Enabling access to a resource for your data plane infrastructure.
  The most common case occurs when using your container registry task container images.
  In that case, refer to [Enabling Azure Container Registry](./enabling-azure-container-registry) to configure the {{< key product_name >}} data plane to access that registry.
* **Task code access**:
  Enabling access to a resource for your task code.
  For example, your task code might need to access Azure Blob Storage at runtime.
  This involves granting permission to the [User-assigned managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) attached to the Kubernetes cluster within which your task code runs.

## Infrastructure-level access

Infrastructure access with non-{{< key product_name >}}-managed Azure resources will require additional configuration. Refer to [Enabling Azure Container Registry](./enabling-azure-container-registry) if you need access to images within an existing or non-{{< key product_name >}}-managed container registry.

## Task code access

{{< key product_name >}} tasks run within a {{< key product_name >}}-managed Kubernetes pod in your data plane. {{< key product_name >}} uses [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview?tabs=dotnet) to create user-assigned managed identities and access {{< key product_name >}}-managed Azure resources. Additional permissions can be granted to the user-assigned managed identity to access Azure resources within the same Tenant.

{{< key product_name >}} on Azure has two types of access arrangements:

* **Domain-scoped access**: With this arrangement, you define permissions you want to grant to your tasks, which are applied only to a specific {{< key product_name >}} domain.
* **Global access**: With this arrangement, you define permissions you want to grant to your tasks, which are applied to an entire Azure subscription or resource group.

> [!NOTE] Azure only supports scoping by domain
> In AWS-based data planes, scoping by both project _and_ domain is supported.
> However, due to intrinsic architectural constraints, Azure-based data planes only support scoping by domain.

Global access is recommended for most use cases since it is simpler. Still, if you have a compelling reason to restrict access, then the subscription/resource group-domain-scoped access is available at the cost of additional complexity in setup.

> [!NOTE] Relationship with RBAC
> The permissions being discussed here are attached to a domain.
> This is independent of the permissions granted to users and machine applications through {{< key product_name >}}'s role-based access control (see [User management](../../user-guide/administration/user-management)).
> But, the two types of permissions are related.
>
> For example, for a user (or machine application) to have read access to a blob storage container, two things are required:
>
> * The user (or machine application) must have **execute** permission for the project and domain where the code that does the reading resides.
> * The domain must have read permission for the blob storage container.

## Domain-scoped access

**Because of the way that Azure works internally, domain-scoped access can only be configured by the {{< key product_name >}} team.**

Please work directly with the {{< key product_name >}} team if you have requirements that involve domain-scoped access to cloud resources.

## Globally-scoped access

{{< key product_name >}} creates a managed identity prefixed with `flyteuser` within the resource group that contains the other {{< key product_name >}}-managed data plane Azure resources. Navigate to [Azure portal Managed Identities](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity%2FuserAssignedIdentities) to find respective managed identity details.

Follow [Azure's official assigned roles documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal) to assign an appropriate role to scope.
