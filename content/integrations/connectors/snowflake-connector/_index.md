## Local testing

To test the Snowflake connector locally, create a class for the connector task that inherits from
[AsyncConnectorExecutorMixin](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytekit/blob/1bc8302bb7a6cf4c7048a7f93627ee25fc6b88c4/flytekit/extend/backend/base_connector.py#L354).
This mixin can handle asynchronous tasks and allows the SDK to mimic the system's behavior in calling the connector.

For more information, see [Testing connectors locally](../#testing-your-connector-locally).

> [!NOTE]
> In some cases, you will need to store credentials in your local environment when testing locally.
