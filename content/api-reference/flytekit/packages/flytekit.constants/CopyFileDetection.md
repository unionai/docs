# CopyFileDetection

**Package:** `flytekit.constants`

Create a collection of name/value pairs.

Example enumeration:

>>> class Color(Enum):
...     RED = 1
...     BLUE = 2
...     GREEN = 3

Access them by:

- attribute access:

>>> Color.RED
<Color.RED: 1>

- value lookup:

>>> Color(1)
<Color.RED: 1>

- name lookup:

>>> Color['RED']
<Color.RED: 1>

Enumerations can be iterated over, and know how many members they have:

>>> len(Color)
3

>>> list(Color)
[<Color.RED: 1>, <Color.BLUE: 2>, <Color.GREEN: 3>]

Methods can be added to enumerations, and members can have their own
attributes -- see the documentation for details.
