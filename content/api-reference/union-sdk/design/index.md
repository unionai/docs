# Design

The flytekit SDK contains the following components:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 0
:widths: 20 30

* - {doc}`Models files <models-files>`
  - Protobuf generated files.
* - {doc}`Authoring structure <authoring-structure>`
  - This provides the core Flyte authoring experience, allowing you to write tasks, workflows, and launch plans.
* - {doc}`Execution time support <execution-time-support>`
  - A small shim layer that handles interaction with the Flyte ecosystem at execution time.
```
