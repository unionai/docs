# Contributing to Flyte

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Flyte!

Here are some guidelines for you to follow, which will make your first and follow-up contributions easier.

TL;DR: Find the repo-specific contribution guidelines in the [Component Reference](#component-reference) section.

## üíª Becoming a contributor

An issue tagged with [`good first issue`](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/labels/good%20first%20issue) is the best place to start for first-time contributors.

**Fork and clone the concerned repository. Create a new branch on your fork and make the required changes. Create a pull request once your work is ready for review.**

> [!NOTE]
> To open a pull request, refer to [GitHub's guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for detailed instructions.

Example PR for your reference: [GitHub PR](https://github.com/flyteorg/flytepropeller/pull/242).
Several checks are introduced to help maintain the robustness of the project:

1. To get through DCO, sign off on every commit ([Reference](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/developer-community/fix-DCO.md)).
2. To improve code coverage, write unit tests to test your code.
3. Make sure all the tests pass. If you face any issues, please let us know in the [`#contribute`](https://flyte-org.slack.com/archives/C04NJPLRWUX) channel.
4. Format your Go code with `golangci-lint` followed by `goimports` (use `make lint` and `make goimports`).
5. Format your Python code with `black` and `isort` (use `make fmt`).
6. If make targets are not available, you can manually format the code.

> [!NOTE]
> Refer to [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go), [Black](https://github.com/psf/black), and [Isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for full coding standards.

As you become more involved with the project, you may be able to be added as a committer to the repos you're working on. Check out the [Flyte Contributor Ladder](https://github.com/flyteorg/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#community-roles-and-path-to-maintainership) to learn more.

### Before submitting your PR

We strongly encourage you to add one of these labels to your Pull Request:

- **added**: For new features.
- **changed**: For changes in existing functionality.
- **deprecated**: For soon-to-be-removed features.
- **removed**: For features being removed.
- **fixed**: For any bug fixes.
- **security**: In case of vulnerabilities.

This is helpful to build human-readable release notes. [Learn more](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

> [!NOTE]
> Learn how to apply a label to a PR in the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels#applying-a-label).
