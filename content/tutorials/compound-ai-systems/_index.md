# Compound AI Systems

Compound AI Systems refer to artificial intelligence systems that combine multiple

different modalities and software components like databases, vector stores, and
more to solve a given task or problem.

In the following examples, youâ€™ll explore how Compound AI Systems can be applied
to manipulate and analyze various types of data.
