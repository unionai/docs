# Batch agent example

The Batch API agent allows you to submit requests for asynchronous batch processing on OpenAI. You can provide either a JSONL file or a JSON iterator, and the agent handles the upload to OpenAI, creation of the batch, and downloading of the output and error files.

This example demonstrates how to send a batch of API requests to GPT models for asynchronous processing.

Every batch input should include `custom_id`, `method`, `url`, and `body`.

You can provide either a `JSONLFile` or `Iterator[JSON]`, and the agent handles the file upload to OpenAI creation of the batch, and downloading of the output and error files.

## Using `Iterator`

Here's how you can provide an `Iterator` as an input to the agent:

```{rli} https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks/master/examples/openai_batch_agent/openai_batch_agent/openai_batch_agent_example_usage.py
:language: python
:lines: 16-64
```

The `create_batch` function returns an imperative workflow responsible for uploading the JSON data to OpenAI, creating a batch, polling the status of the batch to check for completion, and downloading the output and error files. It also accepts a `config` parameter, allowing you to provide `metadata`, `endpoint`, and `completion_window` values. These parameters default to their respective default values.

`BatchResult` is a dataclass that contains the paths to the output file and the error file.

## Using `JSONLFile`

The following code snippet demonstrates how to send a JSONL file to the `create_batch` function:

```{rli} https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyteorg/flytesnacks/master/examples/openai_batch_agent/openai_batch_agent/openai_batch_agent_example_usage.py
:language: python
:lines: 79-91
```

The iterator **streams JSON objects to a JSONL file**. If you have large batches of requests or have distinct JSON objects that you want to run predictions on, we recommend you use the iterator.
