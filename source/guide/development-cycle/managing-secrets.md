# Managing secrets

You can use secrets to interact with external services through API keys.

## Creating secrets

### Creating a secret on the command line

To create a secret, use the `union create secret` command:

```{code-block} shell
union create secret my_secret
```

You'll be prompted to enter a secret value in the terminal:

```
Enter secret value: ...
```

### Creating a secret from a file

To create a secret from a file, run the following command:

```{code-block} shell
union create secret my_file_secret -f /path/to/file
```

## Listing secrets

You can list existing secrets with the `union get secret` command:

```{code-block} shell
union get secret
```

## Using secrets in workflow code

### Using a secret created on the command line

To use a secret created on the command line, see the example code below. To run the example code:

1. [Create a secret on the command line](#creating-a-secret-on-the-command-line) with the key `my_secret`.
2. Copy the following example code to a new file and save it as `using_secrets.py`.
3. Run the script with `union run --remote using_secrets.py main`.

#### Example code

```{code-block} python
from flytekit import Secret, current_context, task, workflow

@task(secret_requests=[Secret(key="my_secret")])
def t1():
    secret_value = current_context().secrets.get(key="my_secret")
    # do something with the secret. For example, communication with an external API.
    ...
```

```{warning}
Do not return secret values from tasks, as this will expose secrets to the control plane.
```

### Using a secret created from a file

To use a secret created from a file in your workflow code, you must mount it as a file. To run the example code below:

1. [Create a secret from a file](#creating-a-secret-from-a-file) with the key `my_secret`.
2. Copy the example code below to a new file and save it as `using_secrets_file.py`.
4. Run the script with `union run --remote using_secrets_file.py main`.

#### Example code

```{code-block} python
from flytekit import Secret, current_context, task, workflow

@task(
    secret_requests=[
        Secret(key="my_file_secret", mount_requirement=Secret.MountType.FILE),
    ]
)
def t1():
    path_to_secret_file = current_context().secrets.get_secrets_file("my_file_secret")
    with open(path_to_secret_file, "r") as f:
        secret_value = f.read()
    # do something with the secret. For example, communication with an external API.
    ...
```

```{warning}
Do not return secret values from tasks, as this will expose secrets to the control plane.
```

:::{note}
The `get_secrets_file` method takes the secret key and returns the path to the secret file.

## Updating secrets

To update a secret, run the `union update secret` command. You will be prompted to enter a new value:

```{code-block} shell
union update secret my_secret
```

## Deleting secrets

To delete a secret, use the `union delete secret` command:

```{code-block} shell
union delete secret my_secret
```
