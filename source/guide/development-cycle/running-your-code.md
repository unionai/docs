# Running your code

## Set up your development environment

If you have not already done so, follow the [Quick start guide](../quick-start) to sign into the Union UI, set up your local Python environment, and install the `union` command line tool.

## CLI commands for running your code

The `union` CLI provides a set of commands that allow you to deploy and run your code at different stages of the development cycle:

{@# TODO: Link to the union commands below to the union CLI reference section #@}

1. `union run`: For deploying and running a single script immediately in your local Python environment.
2. `union run --remote`: For deploying and running a single script immediately in the cloud on Union.
3. `union register`: For deploying multiple scripts to Union and running them from the Web interface.
{@@ if byoc @@}
4. `union package` and `uctl register`: For deploying workflows to production and for scripting within a CI/CD pipeline.

```{note}
In some cases, you may want to test your code in a local cluster before deploying it to Union.
This step corresponds to using the commands 2, 3, or 4, but targeting your local cluster instead of Union.
For more details, see [Running in a local cluster](./running-in-a-local-cluster).

## Running a script in local Python with `union run`

During the development cycle you will want to run a specific workflow or task in your local Python environment to test it.
To quickly try out the code locally use `union run`:

```{code-block} shell
$ union run workflows/example.py wf --name 'Albert'
```

Here you are invoking `union run` and passing the name of the Python file and the name of the workflow within that file that you want to run.
In addition, you are passing the named parameter `name` and its value.

This command is useful for quickly testing a workflow locally to check for basic errors.
For more details see [union run details](./details-of-union-run.md).

## Running a script on Union with `union run --remote`

To quickly run a workflow on Union, use `union run --remote`:

```{code-block} shell
$ union run --remote --project basic-example --domain development workflows/example.py wf --name 'Albert'
```

Here we are invoking `union run --remote` and passing:
* The project, `basic-example`
* The domain, `development`
* The Python file, `workflows/example.py`
* The workflow within that file that you want to run, `wf`
* The named parameter `name`, and its value

This command will:
* Build the container image defined in your `ImageSpec`.
{@@ if byoc @@}
* Push the image to the container registry specified in that `ImageSpec`.
  * (Don't forget make the image accessible to Union. For example, if you are using GitHub Container Registry, you will need to make the image public.)
{@@ endif @@}
* Package up your code and deploy it to the specified project and domain in Union.
* Run the workflow on Union.

This command is useful for quickly deploying and running a specific workflow on Union.
For more details see [union run details](./details-of-union-run.md).

## Deploying your code to Union with `union register`

```{code-block} shell
$ union register workflows --project basic-example --domain development
```

Here we are registering all the code in the `workflows` directory to the project `basic-example` in the domain `development`.

This command will:
* Build the container image defined in your `ImageSpec`.
{@@ if byoc @@}
* Push the image to the container registry specified in that `ImageSpec`.
  * (Don't forget make the image accessible to Union. For example, if you are using GitHub Container Registry, you will need to make the image public.)
{@@ endif @@}
* Package up your code and deploy it to the specified project and domain in Union.
  * The package will contain the code in the Python package located in the `workflows` directory.
    Note that the presence of the `__init__.py` file in this directory is necessary in order to make
    it a Python package.

  all the workflows in the `workflows` directory.
The command will not run the workflow. You can run it from the Web interface.

This command is useful for deploying your full set of workflows to Union for testing.

## Deploying your code to production with `union package` and `uctl register`

The combination of `union package` and `uctl register` is the standard way of deploying your code to production.
This method is often used in scripts to [build and deploy workflows in a CI/CD pipeline](./ci-cd-deployment).

First, package your workflows:

```{code-block} shell
$ union --pkgs workflows package
```

This will create a tar file called `flyte-package.tgz` of the Python package located in the `workflows` directory.
Note that the presence of the `__init__.py` file in this directory is necessary in order to make it a Python package.

Once the code is packaged you register it using the `uctl` CLI:

```{code-block} shell
$ uctl register files --project basic-example --domain development \
       --archive flyte-package.tgz --version 1.0
```
See [UCTL CLI](../administration/uctl-cli) for more details on how to install and use the `uctl` CLI.
