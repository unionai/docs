# Single sign on setup

Union authentication uses OAuth2 with Okta and supports SAML and OIDC-compliant identity providers (IdP) to configure single sign on (SSO).

To enable SSO, create an app for your preferred identity provider and provide the associated secrets to the Union team.
The team will then complete the process.
