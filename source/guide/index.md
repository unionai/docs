# Guide

The Union AI orchestration platform is based on the [Flyte](https://flyte.org) open-source project.

Flyte is already used by hundreds of major organizations to run machine learning and data pipelines. It handles everything from simple processing jobs to complex multi-step workflows that span multiple teams and use specialized hardware and infrastructure.

However, Flyte requires a team of platform engineers to maintain, extend, and scale.

Union abstracts away the infrastructure, providing a turnkey system that lets your ML engineers and data scientists focus on what they do best without the need for a dedicated team to manage the platform.

Union also extends Flyte with features that improve the development experience, enhance performance and scalability, and enable more efficient use of compute resources. See [Union overview](./union-overview) for more details.
