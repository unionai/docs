# Running your workflow

## Python virtual environment

The first step is to ensure that your `uv.lock` file is properly generated from your `pyproject.toml` file and that your local Python virtual environment is properly set up.

Using `uv`, you can install the dependencies with the command:

```{code-block} shell
$ uv sync
```

You can then activate the virtual environment with:

```{code-block} shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

:::{admonition} `activate` vs `uv run`
When running the `union` CLI within your local project you must run it in the virtual environment _associated with_ that project.
This differs from our earlier usage of the tool when [we installed `union` globally](./local-setup.md#install-the-union-cli) in order to [set up its configuration](./local-setup.md#configure-the-union-cli).

To run union within your project's virtual environment using `uv`, you can prefix it use the `uv run` command. For example:

`uv run union ...`

Alternatively, you can activate the virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` and then run the `union` command directly.

In our examples we assume that you are doing the latter.

## Run the code locally

Because tasks and workflows are defined as regular Python functions, they can be executed in your local Python environment.

You can run the workflow locally with the command [`union run <FILE> <WORKFLOW>`](../../api-reference/union-cli.md#union-cli-commands):

```{code-block} shell
$ union run hello_world.py hello_world_wf
```

You should see output like this:

```{code-block} shell
Running Execution on local.
Hello, world!
```


You can also pass in parameters to the workflow (assuming they declared in the workflow function):

```{code-block} shell
$ union run hello_world.py hello_world_wf --name="everybody"
```

You should see output like this:

```{code-block} shell
Running Execution on local.
Hello, everybody!
```


## Running remotely on Union

Local execution is useful for testing and debugging your workflows.
But to run them at scale, you will need to deploy them (or as we say, "register" them) on to your Union instance.

When task and workflow code is registered on Union:

* The `@union.task` function is loaded into a container defined by the `ImageSpec` object specified in the `container_image` parameter of the decorator.
* The `@union.workflow` function is compiled into a directed acyclic graph that controls the running of the tasks invoked within it.

To run the workflow on Union, add the [`--remote` option](../../api-reference/union-cli.md#union-cli-commands):

```{code-block} shell
$ union run --remote --project my-project --domain development hello_world.py hello_world_wf
```

The output displays a URL that links to the workflow execution in the UI:

{@@ if serverless @@}

```{code-block} shell
üëç Build submitted!
‚è≥ Waiting for build to finish at: https://serverless.union.ai/org/...
‚úÖ Build completed in 0:01:57!

[‚úî] Go to https://serverless.union.ai/org/... to see execution in the UI.
```

{@@ elif byoc or byok or flyte @@}

```{code-block} shell
üëç Build submitted!
‚è≥ Waiting for build to finish at: https://<union-host-url>/org/...
‚úÖ Build completed in 0:01:57!

[‚úî] Go to https://<union-host-url>/org/... to see execution in the UI.
```

{@@ endif @@}

Click the link to see the execution in the UI.

## Register the workflow without running

Above we used the `union run --remote` to register and immediately run a workflow on Union.

This is useful for quick testing, but for more complex workflows you may want to register the workflow first and then run it from the Union interface.

To do this, you can use the `union register` command to register the workflow code with Union.

The form of the command is:

```{code-block} shell
$ union register [<options>] <path-to-source-directory>
```

in our case, from within the `getting-started` directory, you would do:

```{code-block} shell
$ union register --project my-project --domain development .
```

This registers all code in the current directory to Union but does not immediately run anything.
You should see the following output (or similar) in your terminal:

```{code-block} shell
Running pyflyte register from /Users/my-user/scratch/my-project with images ImageConfig(default_image=Image(name='default', fqn='cr.flyte.org/flyteorg/flytekit', tag='py3.12-1.14.6', digest=None), images=[Image(name='default', fqn='cr.flyte.org/flyteorg/flytekit', tag='py3.12-1.14.6', digest=None)]) and image destination folder /root on 1 package(s) ('/Users/my-user/scratch/my-project',)

## Run the workflow from the Union interface

To run the workflow, you need to go to the Union interface:

1. Navigate to the Union dashboard.
2. In the left sidebar, click **Workflows**.
3. Search for your workflow, then select the workflow from the search results.
4. On the workflow page, click **Launch Workflow**.
5. In the "Create New Execution" dialog, you can change the workflow version, launch plan, and inputs (if present). Click "Advanced options" to change the security context, labels, annotations, max parallelism, override the interruptible flag, and overwrite cached inputs.
6. To execute the workflow, click **Launch**. You should see the workflow status change to "Running", then "Succeeded" as the execution progresses.

To view the workflow execution graph, click the **Graph** tab above the running workflow.


## View the workflow execution on Union

When you view the workflow execution graph, you will see the following:

![Graph](/_static/images/user-guide/getting-started/running-your-workflow/graph.png)

Above the graph, there is metadata that describes the workflow execution, such as the
duration and the workflow version. Next, click on the `evaluate_model` node to open up a
sidebar that contains additional information about the task:
