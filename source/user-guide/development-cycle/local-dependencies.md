# Local dependencies

During the development cycle you will want to be able to run your workflows both locally on your machine and remotely on Union.
To enable this, you need to ensure that the required dependencies are installed in both places.
Here we will explain how to install your dependencies locally.
For information on how to make your dependencies available on Union, see [Remote dependencies with ImageSpec](./remote-dependencies-with-image-spec.md).

## Create a Python virtual environment

We recommend using a Python virtual environment to manage your project dependencies.
For example, too create a new virtual environment using `conda`, run the following command:

```{code-block} shell
$ conda create --name basic-example-env python=3.11
$ conda activate basic-example-env
```
:::{note}
You can also use other tools, like `venv` to create and manage your virtual environments.

## Install the local dependencies

Make sure that you have activated your `basic-example-env` environment, then install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```{code-block} shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` generated by the `union init` command should look like this:

```{code-block} shell
union
```

It simply specifies the `union` package (which in any case, you have already installed locally).
In an actual project you would specify all the other dependency packages here as well.

Having installed your dependencies in your local environment, you can now [run your workflows locally using `union run`](./running-your-code.md).

The next step is to ensure that the same dependencies are also [available in the remote environment on Union](./remote-dependencies-with-image-spec.md).
