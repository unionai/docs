This is the new Union, based on the new Flyte SDK.

## Why?

The world is evolving. The gap between batch and real-time workflows is shrinking.
Workflow orchestrationâ€”especially multi-step workflows with integrated dataflowâ€”is now a critical need across various domains:

â€¢	**Batch workflows** for large-scale data processing

â€¢	**ETL pipelines** for transforming and moving data

â€¢	**Model training**, often just a single step

â€¢	**Evaluation workflows**

â€¢	**Batch inference** for AI/ML applications

â€¢	**Durable agentic workflows** that persist across failures

â€¢	**Real-time agentic workflows** for interactive applications

â€¢	**Multi-cloud workflows** that run seamlessly across environments

### **This Is the Moment to Innovate**

The opportunity is here to improve, differentiate, and redefine how workflows are built. A superior experience isnâ€™t just a nice-to-haveâ€”itâ€™s how we win.

Some believe the key lies in the backend, others in developer experience (DX), and some in the UI. The truth? Itâ€™s all of them. Innovation must encompass every layer, setting the foundation for the next five years.

### **Key Learnings Shaping the Future**

1.	**Pythonâ€™s Dominanceâ€”But Not Exclusivity**

Pythonâ€™s acceptance has grown significantly, but itâ€™s not the only language. TypeScript is becoming increasingly prevalent. A Python-only approach may offer short-term advantages, but long-term success demands broader language support.

2.	**Performance Is Critical**

Speed mattersâ€”not just in execution but in perception. The faster and more responsive a system feels, the better the experience. Optimizing for both real and perceived performance is essential.

3.	**Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Are the New Reality**

Most companies require multi-cloud capabilities as they grapple with the relentless demand for compute resourcesâ€”GPUs, machines, and infrastructure. Workflows no longer reside within a single cloud but increasingly span multiple providers. In this evolving landscape, **serverless, BYOC (Bring Your Own Compute), and BYOK (Bring Your Own Kubernetes)** will seamlessly intertwine, shaping the future of scalable and flexible workflow execution.

4.	**Agentic Workflows Will Lead the Way**

The promise of AI isnâ€™t just in modelsâ€”itâ€™s in **agentic workflows** that drive automation, decision-making, and adaptability. These workflows will be the spearhead of next-generation applications, seamlessly orchestrating AI-driven tasks in real-time and batch environments.

5.	**Model Providers Arenâ€™t the End-Allâ€”Custom Models Will Matter**

While foundation models are powerful, they arenâ€™t a one-size-fits-all solution. Enterprises will increasingly invest in **custom AI models**, fine-tuned to their unique data and needs. The future belongs to those who can seamlessly integrate and operationalize both off-the-shelf and bespoke models.

### **Our Vision: Why Union?**

1.	**For Compound AI Systems (e.g., Autonomous Vehicles, Biotech)**

If youâ€™re building complex AI-driven systems, you need **Union** today. And as AI evolves, Union will evolve with itâ€”getting even better.

2.	**For ML Model Development & Fine-Tuning**

If youâ€™re developing and fine-tuning ML models, **Union** provides the infrastructure to scale effortlessly.

3.	**For Building Functional Agents**

If youâ€™re building agents, **Union should be the safest and fastest place to do it**. This is the most critical need today because it has the widest adoption.

Whatâ€™s compelling is how these needs stack in reverse orderâ€”most people start with **agents** (3), but as they scale, they need **better model fine-tuning** (2), and eventually, they require **a robust system for compound AI applications** (1).

The time to build is now. The future of workflows depends on it. ðŸš€
